    "Proton therapy delivers a targeted radiation dose on a tumor. _Dose_ is a quantity which is the measure of the energy deposited in matter by ionizing radiation per unit mass. The location and quantity of the dose depends on the energy of a proton. \n",
    "\n",
    "The energy of a moving proton is a combination of its rest mass and kinetic energy. Because the velocity of a proton is close to the speed of light, relativistic effects cannot be ignored. The total mass $E_T$ of a proton is given as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_T = \\frac{m_0c^2}{\\gamma^2} - m_0c^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here $m_0$ is the rest mass, $m_0c^2$ the rest energy and $\\gamma=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}^{-1}$. The total mass can also be computed as the squared sum of the kinetic and rest masses. The kinetic energy of a proton is $E_k=pc$, with the relativistic impulse \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p = \\frac{m_0v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The typical kinetic energy of protons in radiation therapy is 100 to 250 MeV (Note: _However, a treatment system that can produce 250 MeV protons must provide adequate neutron shielding for neutrons produced by interactions of a beam of this energy in the treatment head and in a patient._, Sengbush et al.). So we can compute the velocity of a 250 MeV proton:\n"
